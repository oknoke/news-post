Nvidia, valued at over $3 trillion, is the world's second most valuable company and the leading supplier of AI chips. The company's stock dropped nearly 2 percent in premarket trading. Both countries are heavily investing in domestic chip production, with the US funding the CHIPS Act and China creating a new $47.5 billion state fund."
